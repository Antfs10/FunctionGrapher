# FunctionGrapher
Tool that lets you graph math functions

## How to use
Enter the right hand side of the function by typing it, or by using the convenient buttons at your disposal.
Change the graph PRECISION and RANGE to experiment with different detail and zoom levels for the graph view.

## Why I made this
I wanted a tool to use in high school math class to experiment with functions as well as to further my understanding of them.
This project also taught me how to use graphics in Java and ways to draw graphs with smooth curves (Lerping points).

## Libraries
FUnction Grapher uses the exp4j library to evaluate the right hand side of the expression to find the y coordinate.
